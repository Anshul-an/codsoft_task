CODSOFT AI Internship
This repository contains the projects I completed during my AI internship with CODSOFT.
I have successfully completed all tasks assigned to me during the internship.
Each task focuses on a different concept â€” from building interactive games to developing an AI-based recommendation system.

âœ… Task 1: Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯
Description:
A beginner-friendly Python game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it correctly.

Highlights:

-Uses random.randint() to generate a secret number

-Provides feedback like Too High, Too Low, or Correct!

-Simple and clean command-line interface

-Option to replay the game after winning


âœ… Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI ðŸ¤–
Description:
A Python version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against the computer. The computer uses a simple Minimax algorithm to play intelligently.

Highlights:

-Two-player (user vs computer) turn-based logic

-AI opponent makes smart decisions using the Minimax algorithm

-Detects wins, losses, and draw conditions

-Console-based display with a 3x3 board



âœ… Task 4: Recommendation System ðŸŽ¬
Description:
A smart movie recommender built using Streamlit, TF-IDF, and cosine similarity.
Users can search for a movie title or genre, and get personalized recommendations based on content similarity.

Highlights:

-Content-based filtering using TF-IDF and cosine similarity

-Search by movie title (e.g., Inception) or genre (e.g., Action)

-Results include movie titles, genres, and descriptions

-Scrollable, clean user interface built using Streamlit

-Runs entirely in the browser
